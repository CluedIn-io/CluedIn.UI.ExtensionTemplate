# Adding a new Pillar
A pillar is most simply thought of as a section of the application. It can appear in the top level of the main navigation.

An example pillar is provided in [src/pillars/examplePillar.js](../src/pillars/examplePillar.js). This example can be seen on the main menu when running the application.

To add a new Pillar, simply amend or copy the example, and export your new pillar from `src/pillars/index.js`.
